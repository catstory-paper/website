Incision: The eye is prepared for cataract surgery, with the cornea clear and the iris visible beneath a well-dilated pupil. A bright, focused surgical light illuminates the eye, and the camera provides a direct, high-magnification view of the anterior segment, centered on the corneal limbus and the pupil. The keratome is oriented at ~15° to the horizontal plane to create a self-sealing, clear incision. The tip of the instrument is precisely placed at the limbus, where the cornea transitions to the sclera. First, the keratome is advanced steadily and smoothly into the cornea at ~ 1.8 mm, penetrating through the epithelium and Bowman’s layer. The movement is controlled, with a slow, deliberate speed to ensure a clean, precise cut. The blade glides through the tissue with minimal resistance, producing a linear incision.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Viscous agent injection: The eye is in the midst of phaco, with the AC already established and the cornea clear, though the capsule appears opaque due to cataractous changes. A 27-gauge cannula, connected to a viscoelastic delivery system, is introduced through the clear incision, positioned at ~a 45° angle to the cornea. The cannula tip is inserted just anterior to the capsule and oriented toward the posterior chamber, maintaining a distance of about 1–2 mm from the iris to avoid trauma. First, the viscous agent—sodium hyaluronate—begins to flow in a continuous, controlled stream from the cannula. The fluid is injected slowly, at a rate of ~0.05 mL per second, with a steady pressure that prevents sudden pressure surges.

Viscous agent injection: Continuing the viscous agent injection phase. The eye remains in the midst of phaco, with the AC already established and the cornea clear, though the capsule appears opaque due to cataractous changes. The 27-gauge cannula remain in the surgical field. The AC of the eye is fully entered, with the cornea clear and the iris appearing slightly dilated and relaxed. A fine, blunt-tipped cannula with a soft, flexible tip—specifically a viscoelastic delivery cannula—is at the superior limbus, just outside the incision. The cannula is angled at ~15° to the cornea. The instrument is held steady by the surgeon’s hand, with the tip slightly extended to avoid contact with the corneal endothelium. First, the viscoelastic delivery cannula advances gently into the AC, penetrating to ~ 2–3 mm beneath the cornea. The injection begins as a slow, continuous stream of high-viscosity OVD, such as sodium hyaluronate.1 mL per second.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Rhexis: The AC is clearly visualized under high magnification, with the iris appearing dilated and the lens centrally positioned, exhibiting early opacification characteristic of a cataract. A bent, 25-gauge CCC forceps, with a fine, curved tip and a serrated edge, is at the superior edge of the anterior capsule. The instrument is held steadily, its tip oriented at ~45° to the capsule surface. The forceps is used to initiate and propagate a continuous, circular tear in the anterior capsule. First, the surgeon applies gentle, steady pressure with the forceps tip to create a small, initial opening at the 12 o'clock position of the capsule. The instrument advances slowly at ~ ~0.2 mm into the capsule plane, using a controlled, circumferential motion. Then, as the tear progresses, the forceps follows the developing edge of the opening, maintaining a consistent arc and tension.

Rhexis: Continuing the rhexis phase. The AC remains clearly visualized under high magnification, with the iris appearing dilated and the lens centrally positioned, exhibiting early opacification characteristic of a cataract. The 25-gauge CCC forceps and CCC forceps remain in the surgical field. The AC is filled with viscoelastic, providing stability and protection to the corneal endothelium and internal structures. The capsule is taut and clearly visualized under the microscope, with the pupil centered and the iris slightly dilated. A 3.0 mm CCC forceps, with fine, curved, and serrated tips, is at the superior temporal quadrant of the capsule. The instrument is oriented tangentially to the capsule surface, with the forceps tip engaged at the edge of the planned opening. First, the CCC forceps are introduced into the AC and advanced toward the capsule edge at a 15° angle to the cornea. The forceps are gently advanced to ~ ~1.5 mm into the capsule, maintaining a slight forward pressure. Then, the forceps are rotated in a clockwise direction, with a slow, steady, and continuous motion, creating a controlled, 360° circular tear.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Hydrodissection: The AC is fully formed with a clear incision, and the capsule is visible with the nucleus centrally positioned. Two instruments are in use: a 30-gauge cannula with a blunt tip and a 25-gauge I/A handpiece with a side port. The I/A handpiece is held at the 2 o’clock position, its tip angled slightly toward the equator of the lens, ready for irrigation. First, the cannula is advanced steadily into the AC, penetrating ~2 mm into the space between the anterior capsule and the nucleus. The fluid is then injected in a controlled, intermittent pulse, each pulse lasting about 0.5 seconds with a 1-second pause between pulses. Then, as the fluid accumulates, the nucleus begins to shift slightly, rotating clockwise by about 15°.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Phacoemulsification: Phacoemulsification The eye is under surgical visualization with a clear incision already established, and the AC is maintained with viscoelastic. The phaco handpiece, a slender, metallic probe with a 2.2 mm tip, is inserted through the primary incision and positioned vertically, ~1 mm from the anterior capsule edge. First, the phaco probe is activated, and its tip is advanced in a controlled, back-and-forth motion across the nucleus of the cataract. Then, the I/A cannula, positioned at a 45° angle to the phaco tip, continuously aspirates the emulsified lens fragments and irrigates the chamber to maintain pressure and prevent collapse.

Phacoemulsification: Continuing the phacoemulsification phase. The eye remains under surgical visualization with a clear incision already established, and the AC is maintained with viscoelastic. The phaco handpiece and phaco probe remain in the surgical field. Phacoemulsification The eye is under surgical magnification, with the AC clearly visualized through a paracentesis site. A phaco probe, featuring a 1.2 mm tip with a 30° angled tip and a side-port irrigation channel, is at the center of the lens. A second instrument, a bimanual I/A cannula with a 1.0 mm tip and a blunt, rounded end, is placed adjacent to the phaco probe, maintaining a 45° orientation to the cornea and positioned just posterior to the iris plane. First, the phaco probe emits intermittent ultrasonic pulses at 200 microns of amplitude, causing the nucleus to vibrate and fracture into smaller fragments. The probe remains in a fixed position at the anterior pole of the nucleus, with ~ penetration of ~1.

The phaco probe, a 20-gauge, ultrasonic tip with a 1.0 mm diameter and a 30° angled tip, is at the center of the nucleus. The I/A handpiece, a 23-gauge side-port instrument, is placed adjacent to the phaco tip at a 45° angle, maintaining a stable position to aspirate debris and maintain chamber stability. First, the phaco probe is activated, and its ultrasonic vibrations begin to emulsify the nucleus. The tip oscillates rapidly, generating a localized cavitation effect that fragments the dense lens material. The emulsified particles are immediately aspirated through the I/A handpiece, which operates continuously at a flow rate of ~15 mL/min.

The phaco handpiece and phaco probe remain in the surgical field. Phacoemulsification The eye is in a state of controlled surgical exposure, with the AC fully maintained and the cornea clear, allowing direct visualization of the lens. Two instruments are visible: the phaco probe, a 23-gauge, 1.0 mm diameter ultrasonic handpiece with a curved tip, is at a 30° angle to the anterior capsule and is actively engaged with the nucleus. The phaco probe is oriented such that its tip is ~1.5 mm from the anterior capsule, with the tip vibrating at a frequency of 40 kHz. First: The phaco probe is activated, emitting high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations that create a focused energy field at its tip. The probe is moved in a slow, controlled oscillating motion—~2 mm in diameter—within the central region of the nucleus.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Irrigation and aspiration: The eye is in the post-CCC phase of cataract surgery, with a clear, circular opening in the anterior capsule and the nucleus visibly exposed. The I/A probe, featuring a side-port design with a small irrigation aperture near its tip, is inserted through the main incision and oriented tangentially to the anterior capsule. The phaco tip, a slender, 23-gauge instrument with a 1.0 mm tip, is inserted through a separate, adjacent incision and held in a stable, perpendicular orientation to the anterior capsule, with its tip ~1 mm into the lens substance. First, the phaco tip is activated with ultrasonic energy at a frequency of 40 kHz and power set to 25%, initiating a low-intensity emulsification process.

The eye remains in the post-CCC phase of cataract surgery, with a clear, circular opening in the anterior capsule and the nucleus visibly exposed. The I/A probe and phaco tip remain in the surgical field. The eye is under magnification during the irrigation and aspiration phase of cataract surgery, with the AC fully maintained and the cornea clear. The capsule is open, and the nucleus and cortex have been fragmented and are being cleared. The I/A probe, a fine, metallic, hollow-tipped instrument with a beveled tip, is at a 45° angle to the cornea, entering the AC through a clear incision. It is inserted ~1.5 mm deep into the eye, just anterior to the capsule. The side-port cannula, a slightly thicker, blunt-ended metallic tube, is placed through a separate incision adjacent to the main entry site, oriented perpendicular to the cornea to allow for stable fluid exchange. First, the I/A probe is activated at a moderate flow rate of ~10–15 mL/min, with a vacuum level set at 40–60 mmHg.

Two instruments are in use: a 23-gauge phaco handpiece with a side-port irrigation system and a 23-gauge aspiration cannula. The phaco handpiece is at ~a 15° angle to the cornea, with its tip inserted into the AC and oriented toward the central nucleus. First, the phaco handpiece initiates a continuous, ultrasonic oscillation at 40 kHz, emitting high-frequency vibrations to fragment the nucleus. The handpiece tip, measuring 0.6 mm in diameter, moves in a controlled, back-and-forth motion across the nucleus surface at a speed of ~0.5 mm per second, creating micro-oscillations that break down the lens material.

The 23-gauge phaco handpiece and 23-gauge aspiration cannula remain in the surgical field. The eye is in a post-CCC, pre-fragmentation phase, with the anterior capsule fully opened and the nucleus visible through the clear incision. A 2.2 mm bimanual I/A system is employed, consisting of a 20-gauge irrigation handpiece and a 23-gauge aspiration probe. The irrigation handpiece is positioned adjacent to the incision, oriented tangentially to the AC wall, with its tip ~1 mm from the capsule. First, the irrigation handpiece is activated at a constant flow rate of 15–20 mL/min, maintaining intraocular pressure and providing a steady stream of BSS to the AC. Then, the aspiration probe is advanced steadily toward the nucleus, with its tip positioned at ~ ~1.5 mm from the corneal endothelium.

The eye remains in a post-CCC, pre-fragmentation phase, with the anterior capsule fully opened and the nucleus visible through the clear incision. The 23-gauge phaco handpiece and 23-gauge aspiration cannula remain in the surgical field. The eye is under magnified microscopic view, with the cornea clear and the pupil dilated, revealing a cloudy, opaque lens that has been partially disrupted. A 23-gauge I/A probe enters the AC from the superior temporal corneoscleral limbus. Its tip is equipped with a side port for irrigation and a central lumen for aspiration. A second 23-gauge infusion cannula is placed at the opposite limbus to maintain intraocular pressure and stabilize the AC. First, the I/A probe advances into the capsule, with the tip positioned adjacent to the residual cortical material. The surgeon initiates a low-speed aspiration with intermittent irrigation, creating a pulsatile flow that dislodges and emulsifies the soft lens cortex.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Capsule polishing: The eye is in the CCC phase of cataract surgery, with a circular opening created in the anterior capsule. A fine-tipped, curved phaco handpiece, specifically a 27-gauge I/A probe with a side port, is introduced from the lower-left quadrant of the field. The probe is angled at ~15° to the cornea and is positioned just outside the edge of the CCC, maintaining a distance of about 0.5–1 mm from the capsule surface. Its tip is slightly beveled. First, the probe advances gently toward the anterior capsule edge, maintaining a steady, slow trajectory over a span of 2–3 seconds. The tip is then brought into light contact with the capsule margin, and a continuous, low-amplitude oscillating motion begins. This motion is performed in a clockwise rotational pattern, sweeping along the inner rim of the CCC at ~ ~0.1 mm beneath the capsule surface.

Capsule polishing: Continuing the capsule polishing phase. The eye remains in the CCC phase of cataract surgery, with a circular opening created in the anterior capsule. The 27-gauge I/A probe and phaco handpiece remain in the surgical field. The eye is in a post-hydrodissection state, with the anterior capsule clearly visible and the nucleus displaced centrally. A cohesive, fine-tipped cannula-style instrument, the I/A tip, is at the superior-temporal edge of the capsular opening. The tip is angled slightly downward toward the capsule surface at ~15°. The instrument has a smooth, polished metal tip with a 0.5 mm diameter. First, the I/A tip is gently introduced into the AC, maintaining a distance of about 1 mm from the capsule. Then, the tip is slowly moved in a continuous, circular trajectory around the central 3 mm of the anterior capsule, applying minimal suction. The motion is slow and deliberate, lasting ~8 seconds, with intermittent pauses to assess capsule integrity. The tip moves at ~ 0.2 mm from the capsule surface, avoiding contact with the lens cortex.<end_scene>

The capsule is open, and the nucleus has been aspirated, leaving behind a clear capsule. It is held by a handpiece connected to a phaco machine, which delivers ultrasonic energy. A second instrument, a 25-gauge I/A cannula, is positioned adjacent to the phaco needle, its tip aligned with the AC for continuous fluid exchange. First, the phaco needle is activated, emitting high-frequency ultrasonic vibrations at ~40 kHz. The tip vibrates rapidly, creating a micro-oscillating motion that begins to gently disperse any residual lens material from the capsule. The instrument moves slowly, advancing about 1 mm into the capsule in a controlled, back-and-forth motion.<end_scene>

The tip is slowly moved in a circular trajectory around the AC, ~2–3 mm from the corneal endothelium, to avoid endothelial trauma.<end_scene>

<start_scene>Tonifying and antibiotics: The eye is in the immediate post-cataract extraction phase, with the AC partially filled and the incision visible as a clear, linear opening at the lower limbus. A small, curved, 23-gauge microcannula with a transparent polyurethane tip is introduced from the superior-temporal quadrant. The cannula is oriented at a 45° angle to the cornea and advances slowly into the AC, maintaining ~ ~1.5 mm. As the cannula enters, a gentle, continuous flow of BSS is administered into the AC. First, the cannula is at the superior limbus, and the surgeon initiates a steady, uninterrupted infusion of BSS into the AC. The fluid fills the space between the cornea and the iris, increasing the chamber depth from ~2.5 mm to 4.
